# mymodule

This module was made to download and manipulate images. There are four different main.go files. 
Each file contains a different function. One function called GetPic downloads a image from the internet.
Grayscale converts a colored image to grayscale by modifying its RGB values. PrintColor creates a image file with your desired text and in color.
